# Dathering: gatherings for solarpunks

This is a simple dat site to create single page events to share with your friends.  These events are written in the [h-event microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-calendar), so they can be quickly and easily added to anyone's calendar app of choice.

This is a short hack of a site to try out form making using [choo](https://choo.io) and [the beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com).  This repo should not be considered a useful tool in any way yet, and more just an excuse to learn more of both!

The format of the single page was largely inspired by the beautiful event,people, and page at https://shiftctrl.space
